It encompasses all the touch points and communication channels. It’s how the world recognizes and distinguishes Copart from the competition.</p>

		<h1>Logo and Usage</h1>
		<h2>The Copart Logo</h2>
		<p>As the most recognizable brand asset, the logo is our primary brand identifier, and it must appear consistently and in every Copart communication, printed or digital. It is a key brand asset and must be respected whenever it is used.</p>
		<p>Consisting of the Copart wordmark and the ellipsis symbol, the logo is a unique piece of artwork that has been designed specifically to symbolize Copart.</p>
		<p>Never, under any circumstances, should the logo artwork be altered or re-created. Only use the approved files when reproducing and applying the Copart logo.</p>
			<p>Email <a href="www.needslink.com">Advertising@Copart.com</a> to obtain the correct logo files. In your request, include the logo color (full color or black and white), file type required and intended application (digital, paper print, stitching, video, etc.).</p>
			
			<img src="content/logo-usage-1.svg">
			
			<h2>Clear Space and Minimum Size</h2>
			<p>The Copart logo should always be surrounded by a generous field of clear space to ensure its legibility and impact. This isolates the logo and protects it from competing with visual elements such as text and supporting graphics.</p>
			
			<p>As shown below, the absolute minimum amount of clear space that can surround the logo in any application is equal to the size of the “o” in the Copart wordmark.</p>
			
			<p>The Copart logo can be scaled to a variety of sizes. However, to ensure the logo is always legible, it should never be reproduced smaller than .5” in height.</p>
			
			<img src="content/logo-usage-2.svg">
			<img src="content/logo-usage-3.svg" style="width: 20%; margin-top: 24px;">
			
			<h2>Logo Color Variations</h2>
			<p>To accommodate a range of reproduction and printing requirements, two logo color variations are available for use.<br><br>

Keep in mind that the full-color logo is always preferred for brand communications. However, the one-color black version should be used when color reproduction is limited. This variation is especially effective in media such as newsprint.</p>
			<img src="content/logo-usage-4-1.svg" style="width: 50%; margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
			<h2>Background Control</h2>
			<p>The Copart logo should be highly legible in every application. As shown below, the logo and its variations can be positioned against a variety of backgrounds.<br><br>

The full-color logo features well against white and black, as well as photographic backgrounds that provide significant contrast. The one-color variation also displays well against white and black and should be used in single-color print publications.</p>
			
			<img src="content/logo-background-control.svg" style="width: 80%; margin-bottom: 80px; margin-top: 80px;">
			
			<h2>Logo Misuse</h2>
			
			<p>Any misuse of the logo artwork diminishes its integrity and that of the Copart brand as a whole.<br><br>

The examples featured here represent some common misuses that must be avoided whenever working with the logo.<br><br>

Remember that the Copart logo must never, under any circumstances, be altered or re-created in any way.</p>

		<div id="color-palette">
		<h1>Primary Color Palette</h1>
		<p>Color plays an active role in people’s lives. It attracts attention and triggers emotions. Color can influence decisions and behaviors.<br><br>

Consistent use of color supports visual cohesion across our communications and leverages emotional resonance with our brand. When combined with brand-specific imagery and content, color enhances the depth and impact of our story.<br><br>

The colors of the palette shown below are inspired by those found in the Copart logo. Using these colors consistently across communications and various media builds recognition for the Copart brand while contributing to a unified look and feel.<br><br>

The colors of the primary palette can be used for text, color fields and backgrounds.<br><br>

Under no circumstance should the color red be used in any context with the Copart brand, unless identifying another brand such as CrashedToys or National Powersport Auctions (NPA).</p>
			
			<img src="content/color-palette.svg" style="width: 85%;">
			
			<h3>PMS</h3>
			<p>The Pantone® Matching System is a system of thousands of numbered swatches. Most corporate colors, in a logo for example, are identified with a number from this system.</p>
			
			<h3>CYMK</h3>
			<p>This color model is used for print and is also referred to   as process color. It is used to describe the printing process itself. CMYK uses four colors (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) to produce an array of colors.</p>
			
			<h3>RGB</h3>
			<p>This color model is used for digital and web-based color palettes, and it consists of red, green and blue. RGB is the most widely used color system. </p>
			
			<h3>HEX</h3>
			<p>A hex value is an extension of the RGB color model and is used on web pages to specify colors.</p>

		<div id="typography">
		<h1>Typography</h1>
			
		<p>Consistent use of typography is a simple way to align our visual identity. Fonts set a cadence for how a communication is read and can do a lot to alleviate denseness on the most text-heavy pages. The consistent use of the selected typeface families throughout Copart applications adds greatly to a cohesive visual style.<br><br>

The Helvetica Neue font family is a highly legible sans serif made up of 51 fonts, which includes nine weights in three widths. This font family was chosen for its clean lines, availability across most programs, compatibility with the Copart logo and high degree of legibility in all applications.<br><br>

Because of this font’s variety of weights and styles, Helvetica Neue can be used for headlines, titles and primary messaging.</p>

		<div id="email-signature">
		<h1>Email Signature</h1>
		<p>Because email is one of our most common and most visible forms of daily communication, it is imperative we maintain clear, consistent email identification to strengthen the Copart brand.<br><br>

To ensure this consistent image, email signatures in Outlook are automatically generated to meet the brand standards below.<br><br>

Refrain from editing the pre-populated signature. Additions such as inspirational quotes, other images and QR codes are not permitted.<br><br>

If the information or image on your signature is incorrect, email <a href="mailto:advertising@copart.com">Advertising@Copart.com</a> for assistance.</p>

			<div id="best-practices">
	<h1>Best Practices</h1>
	<h2>Email Best Practices</h2>
			
	<p>All Copart employees must use a simple, standard font (preferred: Helvetica Neue or Arial) no larger than 12 pt in all emails. Non-standard typefaces and HTML may not translate across email clients. <br><br>

Images and Logos: Do not use any logos or images within the email signature, other than those automatically generated within Outlook.<br><br>

Quotes: Refraining from the use of quotes or sayings is best practice for professional communications; it is important to avoid the potential confusion of external audiences assuming a particular statement represents Copart’s official slogan, ideology or brand promise.</p>
			
			<h2>Location Best Practices</h2>
			<p>Each Copart location should have printed templates for various situations. Example: yard closures, special events, notices, etc. available at MyCopart.com &gt; Marketing &gt; Yard Marketing Tookit.<br><br>

Each location should have appropriate approved marketing posters and signage. For questions about the current correct in-location merchandising, contact <a href="mailto:advertising@copart.com">Advertising@Copart.com</a>.

Each location should have printed Copart collateral available at all times.<br><br>

For reorders of these materials or general questions, email <a href="mailto:advertising@copart.com">Advertising@Copart.com.</a></p>
			
			<h2>General Best Practices</h2>
			<p>Capitalize the C in Copart.com. <br>
Do not use “A Bid above the Rest.” <br>
Reach out to Marketing for banner or signage requests (excluding external building signage).<br>
Always use a Copart-approved PowerPoint template when creating presentations available on MyCopart.com &gt; Brand Guidelines, Logos and More.<br>
